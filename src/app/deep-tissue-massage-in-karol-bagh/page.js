    { "@type": "Question", name: "What is the first visit offer for deep tissue massage in Karol Bagh?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Our deep tissue massage in Karol Bagh starts at just ₹1999 for a first-visit outlet session — a good way to see if the technique suits you before booking anything longer." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "Is your deep tissue massage spa near Karol Bagh Metro Station?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Yes, our outlet is a short walk from Karol Bagh Metro Station on the Blue Line, easy to reach from Rajendra Place, Patel Nagar, and Jhandewalan." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "Is deep tissue massage painful?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "You may feel some soreness in tight areas, but it should stay within a 'good hurt' range, never sharp. Your therapist checks in throughout and adjusts pressure to what you can actually handle." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "How is deep tissue massage different from a regular full body massage?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "A regular full body massage uses lighter, flowing strokes mainly for relaxation. Deep tissue works more slowly and with real pressure, specifically targeting chronic muscle tension and knots." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "Do you have Russian or other foreign therapists trained in deep tissue technique?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Yes, our Russian, Thai, and Uzbek therapists are trained in deep tissue work alongside our experienced Indian staff, with sessions available from ₹2,800." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "Can I book a night deep tissue massage appointment in Karol Bagh?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Yes, evening and night appointments can be booked in advance through our 24/7 WhatsApp and Telegram help desk, subject to therapist availability." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "Do you offer home deep tissue massage near Karol Bagh?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Yes, alongside our outlet, we send a therapist to your home anywhere in and around Karol Bagh for the same firm, focused technique." } },
    { "@type": "Question", name: "How much does a deep tissue massage cost in Karol Bagh?", acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "A deep tissue massage at our Karol Bagh outlet starts from ₹1999 for the first visit. Home and hotel packages start from ₹15,000 depending on duration." } },
