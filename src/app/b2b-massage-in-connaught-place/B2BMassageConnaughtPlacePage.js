            We're a licensed wellness centre, not a one-off pop-up — every therapist on our Connaught Place team goes through structured training in body-to-body technique, oil selection, and client comfort before they're ever paired with a guest. That's part of why corporate professionals in C.P. keep coming back for post-meeting relaxation instead of trying a new place each time: consistency matters when you're booking a service like this.
