                  <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
                    Thai massage is a traditional healing therapy that started in Thailand many years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
                    Unlike a regular oil massage, Thai massage uses gentle stretching, body movements, and pressure on different parts of the body. Some people even call it "lazy yoga" because the therapist helps stretch your body while you relax.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
                    During the session, you usually wear comfortable clothes, and oil is not always used.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
                    The main goal of Thai massage is to help your body move better, reduce stress, and improve overall wellness.

                  <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
                    A trained therapist uses their hands, thumbs, elbows, knees, and sometimes even their feet to apply gentle pressure and stretch different muscles.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">

                  <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
                    The pressure is adjusted according to your comfort level, so you should always let the therapist know if something feels too strong.
