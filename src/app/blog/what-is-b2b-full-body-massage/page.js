                    A B2B Full Body Massage stands for
                    Body-to-Body Massage. It is a massage
                    style where the therapist uses not only their hands but also
                    other parts of their body, such as the forearms or torso, to
                    create smooth, flowing massage movements.

                  <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
                    The main goal is to help the client relax, reduce muscle

                    comfortable environment.

                    A professional massage session usually begins with a short
                    consultation. The therapist asks a few questions to
                    understand your comfort level and whether there are any
                    health concerns.
                  </p>

                  <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
                    During the massage, smooth massage oil is usually applied,
                    and gentle pressure is used through controlled movements.
                    The pressure is adjusted according to your comfort.

                  <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
