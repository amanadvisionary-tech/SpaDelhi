            <p>
              Aerocity isn't a neighbourhood people live in — it's a hotel district built entirely around IGI Airport, full of travellers who've just gotten off a long flight or are about to board one. That's exactly the situation{" "}
              <Link href="/full-body-massage-in-delhi" className="font-medium text-amber-700 underline hover:text-amber-800">full body massage</Link>{" "}
              is built for: not one sore spot, but a whole body that's stiff from hours in economy or back-to-back meetings. Our Aerocity outlet is a few minutes from Terminal 3, and sessions start from ₹1999.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because so much of Aerocity is hotels — JW Marriott, Pullman, Novotel, Andaz, and more — hotel spa is genuinely one of our most-booked services here rather than an afterthought. Your therapist comes straight to your room with everything needed for a proper full body session, no need to leave the property between meetings or before an early flight. If you're staying nearby in{" "}
              <Link href="/spa-in-vasant-kunj" className="font-medium text-amber-700 underline hover:text-amber-800">Vasant Kunj</Link>{" "}
              or{" "}
              <Link href="/spa-in-mahipalpur" className="font-medium text-amber-700 underline hover:text-amber-800">Mahipalpur</Link>, our outlets there cover the same service too.
            </p>
            <p>
              A full body massage here covers your back, shoulders, arms, legs, and feet — not just whichever area feels worst. For travellers, that matters: long-haul flights leave your entire body stiff, not one localised knot, so a session that only targets one spot misses most of the problem. Our Russian spa in Aerocity packages bring in Russian, Thai, and Uzbek therapists alongside experienced Indian staff, giving you a genuine choice of technique whether you want something gentle after a red-eye or firmer if you've got a couple of hours to properly unwind.
            </p>
            <p>
              Booking is quick over WhatsApp or Telegram, and we're used to short-notice requests given how many guests here are working around flight times rather than a normal schedule. Evening and night appointments can be arranged in advance through our 24/7 desk — genuinely useful if you're landing late or flying out early. Pricing is transparent from the start, whether you're booking the outlet, a hotel room session, or a longer home spa visit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether you've got a few hours before boarding, just landed after a long journey, or you're based at an Aerocity hotel for a work trip, our team can match the session length and technique to whatever window of time you actually have.
            </p>
            <p>
              One thing worth planning around: Aerocity traffic and check-in queues can eat into a tight schedule faster than expected, so if you're booking around a flight, build in a little buffer either side. We'd rather you get the full 60 or 90 minutes you paid for than rush the last twenty minutes because you're watching the clock. If timing is genuinely tight, tell us when you book — we can adjust session length or suggest a shorter, more focused treatment instead of the full routine.
